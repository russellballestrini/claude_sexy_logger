/**
 * Serve the payload the worker precomputed.
 *
 * Building it is two full scans of a 1.6M-row `messages` table — it was
 * eight, and 11.6s, before 2026-09-03 — so a visitor should not be the one
 * paying for them. The worker refreshes it every five minutes; this route
 * rebuilds only when nothing has ever been stored, the first load on a
 * database no worker has run against.
 *
 * Any stored copy is served, whatever its age. This used to reject one
 * older than ten minutes and rebuild in-process, which is exactly when the
 * worker is behind — just restarted, or catching up on ingest — and the
 * rebuild then blocked every request on the server for the length of the
 * scans, on every visit, until the worker caught up. A copy a few minutes
 * old is the right answer; X-Computed-At says how old.
